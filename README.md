Project topic: Airline Classification
Dataset:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/muhammadbinimran/flight-price-prediction/data

This Kaggle dataset on flight prices and other airline statistics is based on data from Expedia, through 3/2019 - 6/2019
Based on this public dataset we will breakdown various metrics associated with the airline industry. Valuable results we wish to calculate will include cheapest days/weeks/months to fly, cheapest airline overall, how much an extra stop will cost an average, and more. Price will act as our dependent variable for the most part since is typically the unkown variable when considering flghts. This project was executed in the Fall of 2024.
